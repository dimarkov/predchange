## Data

Behavioral data from the probabilistic reversal learning task.

This is a subset of data originally published in 

Reiter, A. M., Heinze, H. J., Schlagenhauf, F., & Deserno, L. (2017). 
"Impaired flexible reward-based decision-making in binge eating disorder: 
evidence from computational modeling and functional neuroimaging." 
Neuropsychopharmacology, 42(3), 628. Availible at [](https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.134)

The data is structured as follows

The first column (S) denotes the stimuli with a higher reward probability 
at a given trial. 

The second column (A)  specifies the selected stimuli at a given trial.

The third column (R) specifies the reward obtained at a given trial.

The last column (C) provides the choice correctness, where we defined a
correct choice as the choice in which the stimuli with higher reward probability
was selected.
